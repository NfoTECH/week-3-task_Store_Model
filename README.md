##                  STORE SALES AND MANAGEMENT
### Problem Description
Use your understanding of collections and generics to implement sales and purchase in your store application.
1. Implement priority queue based on customers' FIFO (First In, First Out).
2. Implement priority queue based on the number of Items per customer


### How will I complete this project?
3. Write automated test
4. Organize the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests.
5. Write tests to cover all the methods to be written before development begins (TDD (Test Driven Development)).
6. Make logical assumptions where necessary.



### Steps to evaluate.
7. Classes. At minimum
    1. UML should be used. 
    2. The right visibility modifiers should be used. 
    3. The following concepts/constructs should be used as much as possible
* Encapsulation 
* Inheritance 
* Polymorphism 
* Interfaces/Abstract classes 
* Single Responsibility for classes. 
* Abstraction 
* Aggregation 
* Composition 
* Generics 
* Collections 
* Exception Handling

* Use/Implement a Priority Queue class where applicable.


8. Test Coverage. At minimum 
    1. The tests should cover the methods as well as the conditions/procedures that the methods employ.
